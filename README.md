### Wordsearch Game.

this wordsearch game was created in a way that i could learn the React Fundamentals.
The planning started with a trello board where i identified the project and its implimentation.
the implimentation:
    a grid consisting with a given amount of words in an array.
    i needed to identify the core logic.
        core logic: i would have functions that recieve a list of words and return a grid.
            : to highlight single cells in the grid
            : how to check if they were highlighted
            : how would the user know when the have found all the words in the grid.
            : had to check which were states and which werent.
            
Implimentation:
on my terminal: npx create-react-app your-app
              : cd your-app
              : npm start (to run react)
I also installed npm i react-grid-system.
